# How to classify a thermography image with computer vision

In this project, I try to identify how hot a Formula 1 tire is using a thermal camera.

## Concepts

thermographic cameras detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Any object with a temperature above absolute zero can emit infrared radiation and we can see it without visible lighting using a thermographic camera. Using this technique, we can detect equipment anomalies before they break.
